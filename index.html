            <h1>Chess</h1>
            <p>Chess is my favorite hobby because it is a good sport for the mind. I like to play it with people. I am even in a chess club. I like learning tactics, openings, endgames, special rules and more. Chess has an organization called FIDE. There are also many types of chess like Chess960, Chaturanga and 4-player chess. Chess is actually said to come from the indian game Chaturanga because of it's similarities.
